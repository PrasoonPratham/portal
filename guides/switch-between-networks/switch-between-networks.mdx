## Intro

In this guide we will show you how to switch between networks on your desktop and mobile phone.

## What are networks

There are different types of blockchain. Just like cloud. You have google cloud and apple cloud. In the blockchain world its the same. The two most popular ones for NFTs are Ethereum and Polygon.

### Mainnets vs Testnets

Everything you store on the blockchain is permanent. So you need to be extra careful if you deploy stuff on the blockchain. This also means you cannot 'test' on blockchains such as Ethereum and Polygon. So to test our smart contracts and transactions we use 'Test networks'. These are blockchains that operate exactly like 'Main networks', such as Ethereum and Polygon. However the currency on these networks are free and they are not used for commercial transactions or production use-cases.

## Desktop

### Logging in for the first time

If you log in for the first time on your desktop, you will be able to select a network in the second step after connecting your wallet.

Another way to switch between networks is to click on your wallet inside your browser.

Finally you can also switch between networks inside the thirdweb dashboard.

## Mobile

### Coinbase - Logging in the first time

If you log in the thirdweb for the first time, you can pick a network at the second step. Please note, after switching networks, you might be guided back to step 1: "Let's get started". If this is the case, please continue to follow the page by pressing "Let's get started" and do not skip steps.

### Inside the dashboard

TIP: Make sure you have the app of your chosen wallet installed on your phone and keep it open. This makes it easier for your browser to interact with your wallet.

If you want to switch networks inside the dashboard, click on the menu-icon (top left).

Then click on network and pick the network you want to switch to. In this example I'm switching from Ethereum to Polygon and my Coinbase wallet pops-up to approve the switch

At this stage you might be signed out. No worries. Click on connect wallet and pick your wallet. And now you'll see that you're switched to Polygon.

And now you'll see that you're switched to Polygon.

## WalletConnect - Rainbow wallet

### Logging in for the first time

Open your Rainbow wallet and check if you're network is set to Ethereum.

After connecting your wallet via Walletconnect and choosing rainbow wallet, your network should automatically be the same as your network in the previous step. If it isn't, manually select the **same** network. If you want to switch networks, this will be shown in the next step.

### Switching networks from the dashboard

In the dashboard first disconnect your wallet.

Then change the network. In this example we are changing from Ethereum to Rinkeby.

Next go to your wallet app on your phone and change the network to the same network you chose in the previous step. In this case Rinkeby.

The browser should redirect you to the rainbow app. Approve the connection.
